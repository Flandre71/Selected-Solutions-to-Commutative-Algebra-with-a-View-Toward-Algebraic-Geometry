# Selected Solutions to *Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry* by David Eisenbud

## About This Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to selected exercises from David Eisenbud's *Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry*.

The problems are selected based on the homework assignments of the course **MAT5340: Algebraic Geometry**, which I am currently attending as a freshman undergraduate. As a result, the current scope is limited to **Chapter 1**.
